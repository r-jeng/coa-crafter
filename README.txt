## COA Crafter

Built for the Food Safety and Quality Department, a way to generate Certificate of Analysis for Finished Products.

An app built to quickly create Final Product Certificate of Analysis for current customers in a preformatted pdf with the inputted information and company header. User will be able to track pending COAs and search for previously created COAs stored in the database.

Auto-generating pdf capabilities to decrease time spent on manually creating a product COA with a user friendly interface to organize monthly COAs at a glance.

A simple form to input all relevant information to the final product at a click of a button and on submit, saves the ready-to-go COA for easy accessibility all on a single page.

"This product was built with the Quality Department in mind. I hope to assist the Quality Department at any Food Company to help free up any time spent on manually creating COAs with this COA Organizer and Generator!" -Robin J.

To get started, simply clone the repo and install the "200 Server" Chrome extension to direct the pdf downloads to the App and you're all ready to go!

"An amazing product that assisted in significantly decreasing the amount of time needed to create COAs manually!" -ChocoBear Meister (Quality Dept.)
